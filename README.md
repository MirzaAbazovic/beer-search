# Build a website about beer :) 
Youâ€™re free in choosing languages and frameworks and how much you want to use from the following API: http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs

## Requirements:
1. The application should run without any additional (manual) tweaks
2. You should be able to search for beer, sort and filter the results and show detail information about the beer.
3. Display the results in an organized way and make it look good ;)
4. Nice to have: using a source control system like GitHub with multiple check-ins and of course, tests!

## Step 1
Analyse API  http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs more specific 
http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs-endpoint/beer_index and http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs-endpoint/beer_index and json structure of Beer entity.
See also form for adding beer http://www.brewerydb.com/add/beer-details/breweryId/zf0Of4 to get better understanding about beer entity(model).  

## Step 2
 Use https://app.quicktype.io/to convert json into C# classes Beer.cs (and deppendant classes like Style.cs) in order to create model.
